# Scale up / Scale out

### Scalability
> Scalability is the capability of a system, network, or process to handle a growing amount of work, or its potential to be enlarged to accommodate that growth.
> For example, a system is considered scalable if it is capable of increasing its total output under an increased load when resources (typically hardware) are added. An analogous meaning is implied when the word is used in an economic context, where a company's scalability implies that the underlying business model offers the potential for economic growth within the company.

- Mostly scale-out is better than scale-up.
- ain factor : Distributed computing vs Centralized computing

### Scale up
- good for standalone system
- examples
  * HDD -> SSD
  * CPU core up

  * Memory up
  * Network adaptor up

### Scale out
- Architecture
  * e.g. L4, L7
- Auto scaling
- HA & etc
  * health check (active / passive)
  * failover
  * circuit breaker (especially for MSA architecture)

# Cache
> In computing, a cache is a hardware or software component that stores data so future requests for that data can be served faster; the data stored in a cache might be the result of an earlier computation, or the duplicate of data stored elsewhere. 

> A cache hit occurs when the requested data can be found in a cache, while a cache miss occurs when it cannot. Cache hits are served by reading data from the cache, which is faster than recomputing a result or reading from a slower data store; thus, the more requests can be served from the cache, the faster the system performs.
