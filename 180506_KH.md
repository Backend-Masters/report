# Scale up / Scale out

### Scalability
> Scalability is the capability of a system, network, or process to handle a growing amount of work, or its potential to be enlarged to accommodate that growth.
> For example, a system is considered scalable if it is capable of increasing its total output under an increased load when resources (typically hardware) are added. An analogous meaning is implied when the word is used in an economic context, where a company's scalability implies that the underlying business model offers the potential for economic growth within the company.

- Mostly scale-out is better than scale-up.
- ain factor : Distributed computing vs Centralized computing

### Scale up
- good for standalone system
- examples
  * HDD -> SSD
  * CPU core up

  * Memory up
  * Network adaptor up

### Scale out
- Architecture
  * e.g. L4, L7
- Auto scaling
- HA & etc
  * health check (active / passive)
  * failover
  * circuit breaker (especially for MSA architecture)
